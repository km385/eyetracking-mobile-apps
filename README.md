### Important Notes:
- **Only raw files** should be placed in the `data/` folder. Processed or cleaned data will be automatically saved in the `data-clean/` folder.
- Do not add large datasets or temporary files to the Git repository. These are excluded via the `.gitignore` file.

## How to Add New Data
- Place any new raw data files (e.g., `AggregatedAOImetrics.csv`, `FixationTable.csv`) inside the `data/` folder.
- Run the data processing scripts to combine and clean the data into `data-clean/`.
